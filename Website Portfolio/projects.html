                    This project was for Scream Jam 2025, a week long game jam with no specific theme.
                    I loved getting to be able to produce this game and work with my teammates to create a product we were all super proud of which utilized C#, Unity, Git, and HTML.
                    I also got to learn how to use microphone input for web builds through this project and loved getting to gain that experience!

                    In this project, I utilized Unity, C#, and Git to create a vertical slice demo of our pre-production prototype.
                    It was through this project I learned how to use Scrum Project Management and the importance of game design decisions being based in research.
                    I loved every second of this project and intend to continute working on it in free time!

                    In this project, I worked with a team of 4 to build Pizza is Ready! A game application built on MonoGame and Visual Studio.
                    We used free assets for the in game assets and it was the first game project on MonoGame I had ever built.
                    We also used Trello to organize our project's game plan and ideas.
